<h1>OK-Robot: The Devil is in the Details when Applying Large Open-Knowledge Models to Robotics</h1>

<p>Remarkable progress has been made in recent years in the fields of vision, language, and robotics. We now have vision models capable of recognizing objects based on language queries, navigation systems that can effectively control mobile systems, and grasping models that can handle a wide range of objects. Despite these advancements, general-purpose applications of robotics still lags behind, even though its capabilities rely on recognition, navigation, and grasping. In this paper, we adopt a systems-first approach to develop a new Open Knowledge based robotics framework called OK-Robot. By combining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for object detection, navigation primitives for movement, and grasping primitives for object manipulation, OK-Robot offers a integrated solution for pick-and-drop operations without requiring any training. To evaluate its performance, we run OK-Robot in 10 real-world home environments. The results demonstrate that OK-Robot achieves a 60% success rate in open ended pick-and-drop tasks, representing a new state-of-the-art in Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) with nearly 1.8Ã— the performance of prior work. However, the most important insight gained from OK-Robot is the critical role of nuanced details when combining Open Knowledge systems like VLMs with robotic modules. To facilitate further research and development, OK-Robot is open-sourced, and its capabilities can be visualized on our project website.</p>
